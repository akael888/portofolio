    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <p>I like to play Single Player type of games, because of how easy it is to get it off my hand if i need to do something else</p>
    <p>Single Player games that i like :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Persona Series</li>
        <li>State of Decay Series</li>
        <li>Project Zomboid</li>
        <li>Dying Light</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Data Managing</h2>
    <p>I love to see organized data. It feels calming and satisfying to feel in control. I used to make this database for my laundries, sort of like Social Link Management</p>
